# School_data_base
DataBase and organizing app for school workers
Hi! 
I'm studing python, probably I'm not a 0 in it already, but not far away.
My wife works in school administration and struggle with huge amount of table data, so I decided to practice and make my first steps in IT with such case:
1) It should be a data base of students with different filters (class, age, sex and so on.)
2) You should be able to upload and download data in excel tables and word docs. 
3) Would be great to create calendar and notifications inside app.

There are 3 main tasks for me to study and create. I will upload my code step by step and if you have any suggestions, will be happy to hear it.
Let's go.
